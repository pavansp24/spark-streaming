Spark streaming example

- Run Product streaming calss

- Run the kafka producer class -> This will publish records to kafka topic that will be read by streaming application for every 1 min

Streaming application uses spark sql to do the analysis and developers can use it to get different kind of metrics. 

More can be done by publishing the metrics to cassandra or any db and running apache super set for Business Interlligence.
